It is a single player story-based 2D game written with Python PyGame library. The game consists of 4 chapters. The story flow changes slightly depending on the choices. There is a secret achievement and an alternate ending.

Battles are turn-based. The first one to start is randomly selected. Damage probability depends on abilities.

Skills can be increased with XP from battles and events. Basic attributes decrease as a result of each action. If Health, Hunger and Fatigue drop to 0, the character dies. When dying, skills are reduced to 0, while basic attributes are filled.
